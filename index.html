   <p style="text-align: center"> A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the 
journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face. The one 
who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand: “TODAY MY BEST 
FRIEND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE.” </p>
     
 <p> They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where 
they decided to take a bath. The one, who had been slapped, got stuck in the mire and 
started drowning, but the friend saved him. After the friend recovered from the near 
drowning, he wrote on a stone: “TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE.”The friend who 
had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, “After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand 
and now, you write on a stone, why?” </p>
      <p> The other friend replied: “When someone hurts us, we should write it down in sand where 
winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we 
must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.”

 <h1 align="center"> THE THREE THIEVES </h1>
 
  <p> One Morning, three thieves stole a lot of money from a rich man’s house. They put the money 
in a bag and went to the forest. They felt very hungry. So, one of them went to a nearby 
village to buy food. The other two remained in the forest to take care of the bag of money.
The thief that went for food had an evil idea. He ate his food at a hotel. Then he bought 
food for his two mates in the forest. He mixed a strong poison with the food. He thought, 
“Those two will eat this poisoned food and die. Then I will get all the money for myself.”
Meanwhile, the two wicked men in the forest decided to kill their mate on return. They 
thought that they would divide the money between the two of them. All the three wicked 
men carried out their cruel plans. The thief who wanted all the money for himself came to 
the forest with the poisoned food. <div style="background-color: purple">
   The two men in the forest hit him and killed him. Then 
they ate the poisoned food and died.
Thus, these evil people met with an evil end.
